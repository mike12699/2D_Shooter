# 2D_Shooter (Updated 12/08/2021)
A simple 2D platformer shooter with inspirations from the Metroid games

*Update 12/08/2021*:
I added some UI assets for the player and the enemies. I included animations for both of these as well. When the player shoots at the enemies enough times, they will trigger a death state. As of now, there is no win state yet, and I plan to implement that by next week. The intent was to make the player reach the end of the level, which will trigger the end state of the game. I feel like I have been going at a steady pace, but at this rate, only one level will be finished for the final. I have implemented the building blocks of the game already, so it's just a matter of time to add the remaining assets.
